Here's a more detailed example talconfig.yaml . To see all the available options of the configuration file, head over to Configuration Reference . DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) in talconfig.yaml A lot of times, you have similar configurations for all your nodes. Instead of writing them multiple times for each node, you can make use of controlPlane and worker fields as \"global configurations\" for all your node group. --- clusterName : my-cluster nodes : - hostname : cp1 controlPlane : true ipAddress : 192.168.200.11 installDisk : /dev/sda - hostname : cp2 controlPlane : true ipAddress : 192.168.200.12 installDisk : /dev/sda controlPlane : schematic : customization : extraKernelArgs : - net.ifnames=0 patches : - |- - op: add path: /machine/kubelet/extraArgs value: rotate-server-certificates: \"true\" The schematic and patches defined in controlPlane will be applied to both cp1 and cp2 because they're both in the group of controlPlane nodes. Note NodeConfigs you define in controlPlane or worker will be overwritten if you define them per node in nodes[] section. But, for patches and extraManifests they are appended instead because it makes more sense. You can modify the default behavior by adding overridePatches: true and overrideExtraManifests: true inside nodes[] for node you don't want the default behavior. Adding Talos extensions and kernel arguments Talos v1.5 introduced a new unified way to generate boot assets for installer container image that you can build yourself using their imager container or use image-factory to dynamically build it for you. The old way of installing system extensions using machine.install.extensions in the configuration file is being deprecated, so it's not recommended to use it. Talhelper can help you to generate the installer url like image-factory if you provide schematic for your nodes. Let's say your warmachine node is using Intel processor so you want to have intel-ucode extension and you also want to use traditional network interface naming by providing net.ifnames=0 to the kernel argument. Your talhelper.yaml should be something like this: --- clusterName : my-cluster talosVersion : v1.5.4 endpoint : https://192.168.200.10:6443 nodes : - hostname : warmachine controlPlane : false ipAddress : 192.168.200.12 schematic : customization : extraKernelArgs : - net.ifnames=0 systemExtensions : officialExtensions : - siderolabs/intel-ucode When you run talhelper genconfig , the generated manifest file for warmachine will have machine.install.image value of factory.talos.dev/installer/9e8cc193609699825d61c039c7738d81cf29c7b20f2a91d8f5c540511b9ea0b4:v1.5.4 , which will be the same url you'll get if using image-factory . If you don't want to use the url from image-factory or you want to use your own installer image, you can use per node talosImageURL like this: --- clusterName : my-cluster talosVersion : v1.5.4 endpoint : https://192.168.200.10:6443 nodes : - hostname : warmachine controlPlane : false ipAddress : 192.168.200.12 talosImageURL : my.registry/install/talos-installer-image This will result in machine.install.image value to be my.registry/install/talos-installer-image:v1.5.4 . Adding Ingress Firewall and extra manifests for each node With the addition of Ingress Firewall in Talos v1.6 and their future plan of multi-document machine configuration, you can now add firewall rules and extra manifests for each node. Let's say you want to strengthen your nodes like described in the recommended rules . You can achieve it like so: --- clusterName : my-cluster endpoint : https://192.168.200.10:6443 clusterSvcNets : - ${CLUSTER_SUBNET} ## Define this in your talenv.yaml file controlPlane : ingressFirewall : defaultAction : block rules : - name : kubelet-ingress portSelector : ports : - 10250 protocol : tcp ingress : - subnet : ${CLUSTER_SUBNET} - name : apid-ingress portSelector : ports : - 50000 protocol : tcp ingress : - subnet : 0.0.0.0/0 - subnet : ::/0 - ... nodes : - name : worker1 controlPlane : false ipAddress : 192.168.200.12 extraManifests : - worker1-firewall.yaml You can add ingressFirewall and extraManifests below controlPlane or worker field for node groups that you want to apply. Or you can add them to nodes[] field for specific node you want to apply. Templating extra manifests You can use Go templating inside the files listed under extraManifests . Let's say you want to generate v1alpha1.NetworkRuleConfig that accepts/blocks port 50000 or 50001 depending on the node type coming from your serviceSubnets network: ./talconfig.yaml --- clusterName : mycluster clusterSvcNets : - 10.96.0.0/12 - 2001:db8::/64 nodes : - hostname : cp controlPlane : true extraManifests : - ./firewall.yaml - hostname : worker controlPlane : false extraManifests : - ./firewall.yaml ./firewall.yaml --- apiVersion : v1alpha1 kind : NetworkRuleConfig name : testing portSelector : ports : {{ - if ne .MachineConfig.MachineType \"worker\" }} - 50000 {{ - else }} - 50001 {{ - end }} protocol : tcp ingress : {{ - range $subnet : = .ClusterConfig.ClusterNetwork.ServiceSubnet }} - subnet : {{ $subnet }} {{ - end - }} After running talhelper genconfig command, you'll get: ./clusterconfig/mycluster-cp.yaml --- ... # generated v1alpha1.Config document goes here --- apiVersion : v1alpha1 kind : NetworkRuleConfig name : testing portSelector : ports : - 50000 protocol : tcp ingress : - subnet : 10.96.0.0/12 - subnet : 2001:db8::/64 ./clusterconfig/mycluster-worker.yaml --- ... # generated v1alpha1.Config document goes here --- apiVersion : v1alpha1 kind : NetworkRuleConfig name : testing portSelector : ports : - 50001 protocol : tcp ingress : - subnet : 10.96.0.0/12 - subnet : 2001:db8::/64 To get all the available data fields that you can use, the easiest place that I can find is from upstream source code . Configuring SOPS for Talhelper sops is a simple and flexible tool for managing secrets. If you haven't used sops before, the easiest way to get started is by using age as the encryption tool of choice. To configure talhelper to use sops to encrypt and decrypt your secrets, here's the simplified step by step you can do: Install both sops and age into your system. Run age-keygen -o <sops-config-dir>/age/keys.txt . By default, <sops-config-dir> will be in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sops and falls back to $HOME/.config/sops on Linux, $HOME/Library/Application Support/sops on MacOS, and %AppData%\\sops on Windows. In the directory where your talenv.sops.yaml , and talsecrets.sops.yaml lives, create a .sops.yaml file with this content: --- creation_rules : - age : >- <age-public-key> ## get this in the keys.txt file from previous step Now, if you encrypt your talenv.sops.yaml and talsecret.sops.yaml files with sops , talhelper will be able to decrypt it when generating config files. Using Doppler instead of SOPS If you don't want to use sops as your secret management, you can use Doppler instead (or any other secret managers that can inject environment variables to the shell). Thanks to @truxnell for this genius idea. Here's the simplified step by step to achieve this: In the place where you want to use environment secrets, put it in talconfig.yaml file with ${} placeholder like this: controlPlane : inlinePatch : cluster : aescbcEncryptionSecret : ${AESCBCENCYPTIONKEY} In doppler , create a project named i.e \"talhelper\". In that project, create a config i.e \"env\" that stores key and value of the secret like AESCBCENCYPTIONKEY: <secret>. . Run doppler CLI command that sets environment variable before running the talhelper command i.e: doppler run -p talhelper -c env talhelper genconfig . Thanks to @jtcressy you can also make use of talsecret.yaml file (which is a better way than doing inlinePatch ). Note that you can only put the cluster secrets known by Talos here (you can use talhelper gensecret command and modify it). Here's the simplified step by step to achieve this: In talsecret.yaml file, put all your secrets with ${} placeholder like this: cluster : id : ${CLUSTERNAME} secret : ${CLUSTERSECRET} secrets : bootstraptoken : ${BOOTSTRAPTOKEN} secretboxencryptionsecret : ${AESCBCENCYPTIONKEY} trustdinfo : token : ${TRUSTDTOKEN} certs : etcd : crt : ${ETCDCERT} key : ${ETCDKEY} k8s : crt : ${K8SCERT} key : ${K8SKEY} k8saggregator : crt : ${K8SAGGCERT} key : ${K8SAGGKEY} k8sserviceaccount : key : ${K8SSAKEY} os : crt : ${OSCERT} key : ${OSKEY} In doppler , create a project named i.e \"talhelper\". In that project, create a config i.e \"env\" that stores key and value of the secret like AESCBCENCYPTIONKEY: <secret>. . Run doppler CLI command that sets environment variable before running the talhelper command i.e: doppler run -p talhelper -c env talhelper genconfig . Generating talosctl commands for bash scripting Thanks to the idea and contribution of mirceanton , you can generate talosctl commands for bash scripting in your workflow. For example, in the directory where a talconfig.yaml like this is located: --- clusterName : my-cluster talosVersion : v1.5.5 nodes : - hostname : node1 ipAddress : 192.168.10.11 controlPlane : true After running talhelper genconfig , you can run talhelper gencommand apply | bash in the terminal to apply the generated config into your machine(s) automatically. There are some other gencommand commands that you can use like upgrade , upgrade-k8s , bootstrap , etc, For more information about the available gencommand commands and flags you can use, head over to the documentation . Generate single config file for multiple nodes Thanks to the idea from onedr0p , you can generate a single config file for multiple nodes. This is useful if you have identical hardware for all your nodes and you use DHCP server to manage your node's IP address and hostname. The idea is to set nodes[].ignoreHostname to true and set nodes[].ipAddress to multiple IP addresses separated by comma: --- clusterName : my-cluster nodes : - hostname : controller ipAddress : 192.168.10.11, 192.168.10.12, 192.168.10.13 controlPlane : true ignoreHostname : true - hostname : worker ipAddress : 192.168.10.14, 192.168.10.15, 192.168.10.16 controlPlane : false ignoreHostname : true This will generate my-cluster-controller.yaml and my-cluster-worker.yaml that you can apply with talosctl apply-config command. You can also use talhelper gencommand <command> -n <hostname/IP> to generate the talosctl commands for your nodes. Selfhosted Image Factory By default, the generated manifests will use the official image-factory to pull the installer image. If you're self hosting your own image-factory, you can change your talconfig.yaml like so: --- clusterName : my-cluster imageFactory : registryURL : myfactory.com schematicEndpoint : /schematics protocol : http installerURLTmpl : {{ .RegistryURL }} /installer/{{.ID}}:{{.Version}} The schematicEndpoint is used to do HTTP POST request to get the schematic ID. If your selfhosted image factory doesn't do schematic ID like the official one does, you can pass --offline flag to talhelper genconfig command and modify the installerURLTmpl to your needs. Templating node labels or annotations for system-upgrade-controller Some configuration fields can use Helm-like templating. These templates have the ability to reference other configuration fields and run Sprig functions . This is useful for passing Talos information to Kubernetes workloads, such as system-upgrade-controller plans. To upgrade Talos on a node, the upgrade controller needs the name of the installer image, which is generated by talhelper. This can be added to node annotations as follows: --- nodes : - hostname : my-node nodeAnnotations : installerImage : '{{ .MachineConfig.MachineInstall.InstallImage }}' This can then be queried at upgrade time to determine what image to use: --- apiVersion : upgrade.cattle.io/v1 kind : Plan metadata : name : talos-upgrade spec : serviceAccountName : system-upgrade-controller version : ${TALOS_VERSION} secrets : - name : talos-credentials path : /var/run/secrets/talos.dev upgrade : image : alpine/k8s:1.31.2 envs : - name : NODE_NAME valueFrom : fieldRef : fieldPath : spec.nodeName command : - bash args : - -c - >- INSTALLER_IMAGE=\"$( kubectl get node \"${NODE_NAME}\" -o yaml | yq 'metadata.annotations[\"installerImage\"]' )\" talosctl -n \"${NODE_NAME}\" -e \"${NODE_NAME}\" upgrade \"--image=${INSTALLER_IMAGE}:${SYSTEM_UPGRADE_PLAN_LATEST_VERSION}\" A full example is available here . Editing talconfig.yaml file If you're using a text editor with yaml LSP support, you can use talhelper genschema command to generate a talconfig.json . You can then feed that file to the language server so you can get autocompletion when editing talconfig.yaml file. If your LSP is configured to use JSON schema store , you should get auto-completion working immediately. Shell completion Depending on how you install talhelper , you might not need to do anything to get autocompletion for talhelper commands i.e if you install using the Nix Flakes or AUR. If you don't get it working out of the box, you can use talhelper completion command to generate autocompletion for your shell. bash You will need bash-completion installed and configured on your system first. And then you can put this line somewhere inside your ~/.bashrc file: source < ( talhelper completion bash ) After reloading your shell, autocompletion should be working. To enable bash autocompletion in current session of shell, source the ~/.bashrc file: source ~/.bashrc fish Put this line somewhere inside your ~/.config/fish/config.fish file: talhelper completion fish | source Another way is to put the generated file into ~/.config/fish/completions/talhelper.fish file: talhelper completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/talhelper.fish After reloading your shell, autocompletion should be working. zsh Put this line somewhere inside your ~/.zshrc : source < ( talhelper completion zsh ) After reloading your shell, autocompletion should be working. To enable zsh autocompletion in current session of shell, source the ~/.zshrc file: source ~/.zshrc powershell Append the generated file into $PROFILE : talhelper completion powershell >> $PROFILE After reloading your shell, autocompletion should be working.","title":"Guides"},{"location":"guides/#guides","text":"","title":"Guides"},{"location":"guides/#example-talconfigyaml","text":"A minimal talconfig.yaml file will look like this: --- clusterName : my-cluster endpoint : https://192.168.200.10:6443 nodes : - hostname : master controlPlane : true ipAddress : 192.168.200.11 installDisk : /dev/sda Let's say you want to add labels to the master node and add another worker node named warmachine , you can modify talconfig.yaml like so: --- clusterName : my-cluster endpoint : https://192.168.200.10:6443 nodes : - hostname : master controlPlane : true ipAddress : 192.168.200.11 installDisk : /dev/sda nodeLabels : rack : rack1 - hostname : warmachine controlPlane : false ipAddress : 192.168.200.12 installDiskSelector : size : 128GB Then you can run talhelper genconfig .
