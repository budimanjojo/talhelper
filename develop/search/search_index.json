It was inspired by a python script written by @bjw-s . In a nutshell, this is what talhelper does step by step behind the door: Read and validate talconfig.yaml . Read and decrypt talsecret.yaml or talsecret.sops.yaml with sops if needed. Read and decrypt talenv.yaml or talenv.sops.yaml with sops if needed and load them into environment variables. Do envsubst if needed. Validate and generate Talos and machine config files inside ./clusterconfig directory. Generate .gitignore file so you don't commit the generated files to the public. Why should I use Talhelper The main reason to use talhelper instead of talosctl gen config command to generate Talos machineconfig files is because you want to have them version controlled in your git repository which is currently not possible yet with talosctl . Currently, to create Talos configuration files using the official talosctl tool your steps are: Run talosctl gen config <cluster-name> <cluster-endpoint> and it will generate controlplane.yaml , worker.yaml , talosconfig in the current working directory. Copy and modify those files manually according to your nodes. Run talosctl apply-config --insecure -n <ip-address> --file <your-modified-file.yaml> for each node. This process is fine if you just want to do this once and forget about it. But if you're like me (and many others ), you might want to \"GitOpsified\" this process. So here's where you might want to use talhelper . With talhelper , the steps will become like this: Create a talconfig.yaml . Run talhelper gensecret > talsecret.sops.yaml and encrypt it with sops sops -e -i talsecret.sops.yaml . Run talhelper genconfig . Run talosctl apply-config --insecure -n <ip-address> --file ./clusterconfig/<cluster-name>-<hostname>.yaml for each node. Yes there are more steps needed. But now you can commit your talconfig.yaml and the encrypted talsecret.sops.yaml to your gitops repository and get your whole cluster version controlled. To get started, hop over to the Getting Started section. Alternatives There are some alternatives you can consider instead of talhelper .

Here's a more detailed example talconfig.yaml . To see all the available options of the configuration file, head over to Configuration Reference . Configuring SOPS for Talhelper sops is a simple and flexible tool for managing secrets. If you haven't used sops before, the easiest way to get started is by using age as the encryption tool of choice. To configure talhelper to use sops to encrypt and decrypt your secrets, here's the simplified step by step you can do: Install both sops and age into your system. Run age-keygen -o <sops-config-dir>/age/keys.txt . By default, <sops-config-dir> will be in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sops on Linux, $HOME/Library/Application Support/sops on MacOS, and %AppData%\\sops on Windows. In the directory where your talenv.sops.yaml , and talsecrets.sops.yaml lives, create a .sops.yaml file with this content: --- creation_rules : - age : >- <age-public-key> ## get this in the keys.txt file from previous step Now, if you encrypt your talenv.sops.yaml and talsecret.sops.yaml files with sops , talhelper will be able to decrypt it when generating config files. Using Doppler instead of SOPS If you don't want to use sops as your secret management, you can use Doppler instead (or any other secret managers that can inject environment variables to the shell). Thanks to @truxnell for this genius idea. Here's the simplified step by step to achieve this: In the place where you want to use environment secrets, put it in talconfig.yaml file with ${} placeholder like this: controlPlane : inlinePatch : cluster : aescbcEncryptionSecret : ${AESCBCENCYPTIONKEY} In doppler , create a project named i.e \"talhelper\". In that project, create a config i.e \"env\" that stores key and value of the secret like AESCBCENCYPTIONKEY: <secret>. . Run doppler CLI command that sets environment variable before running the talhelper command i.e: doppler run -p talhelper -c env talhelper genconfig . Shell completion Depending on how you install talhelper , you might not need to do anything to get autocompletion for talhelper commands i.e if you install using the Nix Flakes or AUR. If you don't get it working out of the box, you can use talhelper completion command to generate autocompletion for your shell. bash You will need bash-completion installed and configured on your system first. And then you can put this line somewhere inside your ~/.bashrc file: source < ( talhelper completion bash ) After reloading your shell, autocompletion should be working. To enable bash autocompletion in current session of shell, source the ~/.bashrc file: source ~/.bashrc fish Put this line somewhere inside your ~/.config/fish/config.fish file: talhelper completion fish | source Another way is to put the generated file into ~/.config/fish/completions/talhelper.fish file: talhelper completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/talhelper.fish After reloading your shell, autocompletion should be working. zsh Put this line somewhere inside your ~/.zshrc : source < ( talhelper completion zsh ) After reloading your shell, autocompletion should be working.
