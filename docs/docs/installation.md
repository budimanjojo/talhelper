# Installation

There are several ways to install `talhelper` to your workstation.

## Using aqua

You can get `talhelper` from the standard registry as `budimanjojo/talhelper`.

## Using asdf

You can get `talhelper` with a [plugin](https://github.com/bjw-s/asdf-talhelper) maintained by [@bjw-s](https://github.com/bjw-s).

- Add the plugin

    ```bash
    asdf plugin add talhelper
    ```

- Install the program

    ```bash
    asdf install talhelper latest
    ```

## Using Homebrew

You can get `talhelper` from the official formulae (thanks to [@ishioni](https://github.com/ishioni)).

```
brew install talhelper
```

## Using Nix Flakes

You can get `talhelper` as [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) from the [repository](https://github.com/budimanjojo/talhelper).

- Add the repository as input in your `flake.nix` file

    ```nix
    {
      inputs = {
        talhelper.url = "github:budimanjojo/talhelper";
      }
    }
    ```

- The package is now available at `packages.<system>.default` of the flake. You can call it in your `home.packages` or `environment.systemPackages` or `devShell` by referencing the input as `inputs.talhelper.packages.<system>.default`.
- Additionally we provide a convenient overlay for your nixpkgs
    ```nix
    {
      ...
      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        overlays = [
          inputs.talhelper.overlays.default
        ];
      };
    }
    # In any of the places you define packages
    {
      # Nixos
      environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
        talhelper
      ];
      # Home Manager
      home.packages = with pkgs; [
        talhelper
      ];
      # Flakes
      pkgs.mkShell = with pkgs; [
        talhelper
      ];
    }
    ```
